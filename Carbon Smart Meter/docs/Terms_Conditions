Terms & Conditions ("Terms") 

Carbon Credits Marketplace (CCM)

Effective Q4 2025

The Terms govern your use of the Carbon Smart Meter website, web app, hardware products (including solar panels and VIR sensors), and
related services (collectively, the "Services") provided by Carbon Credits Marketplace (CCM), a New Zealand founded entity. By accessing
the Services, purchasing products, or interacting with us, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Services. The 
Services are available only to users who are at least 18 years old (or the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction).

By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you meet this requirement.

From time to time, we may update these Terms. Your continued use of the Services after updates constitutes acceptance of the changes. 
We will notify you of material changes via the website or app.

Binding Arbitration; Waiver of Jury Trial

These Terms require that all disputes between you and CCM be resolved by binding arbitration. You agree to waive your right to a jury 
trial or class action. Claims must be brought individually. For details, see the Arbitration Agreement below.

Privacy

Your privacy is paramount. See our Privacy Policy: 
(https://github.com/lifebricksglobal/CarbonSmartMeter/blob/b820afb67f3b9affc2234352077c37b983ff92da/Carbon%20Smart%20Meter/docs/Privacy%20Policy) 
for how we handle data (zero PII, anonymized RE data only). The Privacy Policy is incorporated into these Terms.

Ownership of the Services

All content, software, hardware designs, smart contracts, and services on the Services ("CCM Content") are owned by CCM or its licensors
and protected by intellectual property laws. This includes graphics, code (e.g., open source Rust BPF contracts under Apache 2.0), trademarks
and tokenized data products.You may not download, reproduce, or use CCM Content for commercial purposes without written permission. 
You may not misuse CCM Content in ways that confuse consumers, disparage CCM, or infringe IP rights. If the Services assign a device ID 
or on-chain designation, other than self custody wallets, you do not own it and we may change it at any time.

You agree to use the Services only for lawful purposes. Prohibited activities include:

  - Interfering with the Services (e.g., spoofing kWh data, tampering with VIR sensors).
  - Using automated tools to scrape data or bypass restrictions.

Accounts; Passwords; Wallets.

To use the Services, you must bond a self-custodial wallet (e.g., via browser generation or Solflare integration). You are responsible for
maintaining confidentiality of your private keys and wallet. CCM does not store, access, or manage your keys or funds. Rewards are sent directly

Hardware and Software Use

- Hardware (Solar Panels, VIR Sensors): Products are sold "as is" with limited warranties (see separate Hardware Warranty). You must use them as 
intended (e.g., physical connection for kWh mining). Any form of tampering voids rewards and warranties.
- Software (Web App, Smart Contracts): Open source under Apache 2.0. You may modify for personal use but not for fraud (e.g., spoofing device IDs).
- On-Chain Rewards: Reward Token emissions follow the halving schedule and caps (1.5 kWh/day max). wCARBON mints exclusively to CCM Treasury,
no user access or redemption.
- RE Data: Anonymized stats may be aggregated and sold; you consent to non identifiable contributions.

You assume all risks for hardware use (e.g., weather damage, off-grid charging).

Accuracy and Third-Party Links

Services information (e.g., kWh calculations, grid factors) is provided "as is" and may contain errors. Verify independently. CCM disclaims liability
for decisions based on Services data. Links to third party sites (e.g., DEXs like Raydium) are for convenience only. 
CCM is not responsible for their content or practices.

Mobile App and SDK

The web app is mobile optimized (PWA). Use requires a compatible device and internet. You are responsible for data costs. Push notifications can be
disabled in device settings. The Mobile SDK for OEM firmware is provided open source for integration (e.g., auto mining via USB-C). 
OEMs must comply with these Terms.

Disclaimers of Warranties

THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR PURPOSE, OR NON-NFRINGEMENT. CCM DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST VIRUSES,

smart contracts are open-source "as is" with no guarantees on yields or Reward Token eligibility. You assume all risks for blockchain volatility, network 
downtime, or regulatory changes (e.g., CORSIA updates).

Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, CCM SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM USE
