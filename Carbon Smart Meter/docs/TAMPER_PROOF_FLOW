How it works.

[Device] → Private Key → Signs (device_id + VIR + timestamp) → Signature
                                                              ↓
                                                [App] → Public Key → Verifies

On first boot: Device generates Ed25519 keypair.
Every reading: Signs data with the private key.
App & Solana: Verify with public key.
No private key ever leaves device.

Real-World Analogy. 

Ed25519 = User device fingerprint.
Anyone can see the print (public key), but only the user device / fingerprint can create it.
