Executive Summary
Carbon Smart Meter transforms solar panels into a DePIN node that measures, verifies, and tokenizes CO₂ avoidance in real time. 
Users purchase a CCM certified panel (or retrofit an existing one), charge devices and earn reward tokens that are distributed to users. 

Built by Carbon Credits Marketplace (CCM), New Zealand founded, globally operational and with CORSIA aligned pipelines the system bridges 
aviation decarbonization with universal energy access.

The Vision
Buy a panel. Charge your device. Earn Rewards. Offset CO₂. All on-chain.

How It Works
  1. Acquire Hardware
     Purchase a CCM certified 20W–100W foldable solar panel or retrofit an existing panel.
  2. Install Software
     Download the open source Carbon Smart Meter web app.
  3. Activate & Earn
     Bond device to wallet → charge device → mine kWh → accumulate Rewards → Rewards Threshold met = Rewards are paid out.

Technology Stack

Hardware (Field Tested)

→ 20W–100W foldable panels 
→ VIR Sensor (Voltage × Current × Resistance → kWh, <1% error)
→ Tamper proof USB-C / Type-C / 12V adapter
→ Smartphone/tablet as wallet and app host

Software (Open Source – Apache-2.0)

- Web App: [kWh → CO₂e] using region specific grid intensity. Where [kWh → CO₂e] = How much CO₂ equivalent greenhouse 
gas is avoided when 1 kWh of solar energy replaces dirty grid power. Example: using a Conservative default: 0.4 kg CO₂e/kWh,
- Smart Contracts:
→ Primary: Reward Token emission with 2 yearly halving logic
→ Secondary: wCARBON minting → CCM Treasury only for institutional client certification via OTC transactions.
- Wallet Binding: Device ID + on chain registration
- Multi Chain Ready: Solana (native), Ethereum, Polkadot, Cosmos

Security & Verification

- Physical connection required
- Device + wallet binding prevents spoofing
- On-chain immutability for all rewards
- Gold Standard pipeline eligible with funding.

Architecture (Visual Pipeline)

[Sun] → [Panel + VIR] → [App: kWh] → [Oracle: Grid Factor] → [Primary Contract: Reward to Miner] 
→ [Secondary Contract: wCARBON → CCM Treasury]

Sustainable Payout Model

- Cap: 3 kWh/day per device
- Rewards: 1.5–8% of regional electricity price (paid in assigned project Rewards Token)
- Early Scaling: 1.5× multiplier for first 5,000 devices
- Revenue Streams:
  → Hardware margin
  → Offset brokerage (2–5%)
  → Verification fees
  → Renewable Energy data sales in the form of anonymized renewable energy generation statistics.

Tokenomics: Rewards Token & wCARBON

Rewards Token.

Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 (1 Billion)
Utility
  - Earn per verified kWh (regional pricing)
  - Swap freely on multichain DEXs (Jupiter, Uniswap (v3), PancakeSwap )
  - Pay fees (brokerage, verification, data). 

Rewards Emissions (Halving Every 4 Years)
- Epoch 0 (2025–28): 0.5 $Reward Token/kWh
- Epoch 1 (2029–32): 0.25
- Epoch 2 (2033–36): 0.125
- Epoch 3 (2037–40): 0.0625 → continues

→ The rewards emission is inverse to the rewards token Market Cap value whereby early users earn more, with 
fewer rewards paid out as the market cap increases.
→ Epoch = a time based halving cycle where early miners win more and with infinite halving cycles.

Daily Rewards Cap

1.5 kWh/device → max 0.75 Rewards Token/day (high price region)
- Fixed rate: 0.5 $CARBON/kWh (Epoch 0)  

Allocation (1B Total Supply)
- Mining Rewards: 60% (600M) — halving every 4 years open to all Carbon Smart Meter operators  
- Team & Founders: 15% (150M) — 4-yr vest, 1-yr cliff  
- Operations Treasury: 20% (200M) — immediate cash for events, travel, deals and relationships  
- Ecosystem Fund: 3% (30M) — governance  
- Liquidity: 2% (20M) — staged via a gradual release of the 20M Rewards Tokens into DEX liquidity pools 
(e.g., Raydium, Uniswap) over time.


Operations Treasury funds real world growth. Mining allocation remains dominant and staked, until rewards unlock thresholds are met.

Miner Options at Reward Threshold

1) Hold Rewards Token (governance + market upside)
2) Stake Rewards Token (boost mining yields)
3) Swap on DEXs  for BTC, ETH, SOL, USDT, USDC, or any liquidity paired token.

Roadmap

Q4 2025 – Launch

→ CCM certified 20W - 100W panels in production
→ v1.0 Web App open source launch (Solana mainnet with multichain compatibility)
→ 1,000 pilot devices (Argentina/ Brazil, EU, Africa) with associated marketing campaigns to wholesale distributors
→ GDPR/MiCA application audits commence for web app EU access. No EU user access to web app until MiCA approval secured.
→ Early users: 1.5× rewards = the first 1,000 devices get 50% extra Rewards for all kWh mined on that device. 
  This is on-chain, automatic and device locked.

Q1 2026 – Multi-Chain & Retrofit Device Launch

→  Ethereum L2, Polkadot, Cosmos among others
→  Universal Retrofit Kit launch
→  First wCARBON minted to treasury
→  Airline trials begin
→  Aim to begin distributing 5,000 units across Europe, Africa and South America. Population densities equate to shorter sales cycles.
→  Global kWh + CO₂ map dashboard launched on refreshed Carbon Smart Meter website.

Q2 2026 – Gold Standard & Scale

→ Gold Standard methodology applications begin
→ 10K panels shipped
→ Staking v1 launched for miners
→ Rewards Token DAO governance active 
→ Launch of extensive marketing campaign targeting the best performing sales locations, with the intent of onboarding more users.

Q3–Q4 2026 – CORSIA & Enterprise

→ CORSIA Phase 1 eligible offsets
→ Branded enterprise nodes (resorts, mining, military)
→ Mobile SDK for OEM firmware push. This is a software development kit (SDK) provided to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)
like mobile phone makers (e.g., Samsung, Xiaomi, Fairphone), allowing them to embed Carbon Smart Meter functionality directly 
into their devices. With OEM deals we can bundle the software with 100K+ units (e.g., eco-phones + panel bundles across Asia). 
This allows us to scale and 10x - 100x user growth and adoption, with panels supplied and Carbon Smart Meters embedded in every phone.

2027 – Mass Adoption

→ 1M active devices = potentially 1.5M tCO₂e/year to treasury using a 30% buffer for weather and downtime. 
This is calculated with the current 1.5 kWh/day rewards cap.
→ $100M+ in retrofit sensor sales via approved distribution partners
→ Full cross chain bridges are active (IBC, Wormhole).

2029 – Institutional Standard

→ CORSIA Phase 2 integration
→ Second halving from 0.5 Rewards Tokens/kWh to 0.25 Rewards Tokens/kWh
→ DePIN expansion potential into the wind and EV solar industries.

2030+ Global Renewable Proof of impact

→ 10M+ devices
→ Self funded Gold Standard and Verra pipelines
→ 1B+ legacy panels eligible via retrofit
→ Carbon negative network. At this stage the Carbon Smart Meter ecosystem removes more CO₂e than it emits. 

Whitepaper Summary.

The Carbon Smart Meter transforms solar panels into a privacy preserving DePIN node that verifies 
and monetizes CO₂ avoidance in real time.

Novelty: The Infinite Rewards Loop
- User onboards to solar → offsets emissions opening the loop
- Mines kWh → earns Rewards (1.5–8% of regional electricity price)
- Swaps Rewards Token on DEXs → BTC, ETH, SOL, USDT
- Uses proceeds to buy more panels → more kWh → more Rewards
- CCM Treasury mints wCARBON → sells to airlines → funds network growth and expansion
- New user onboards to solar → offsets emissions closing the loop.

As long as the sun shines and blockchains run the loop never stops. 

Built for Scale.
→ Open-source core (Apache-2.0)
→ 20+ L1 adapters in one repo
→ Globally deployed panels
→ CORSIA/IATA compliant by design
→ Retrofit line in development
