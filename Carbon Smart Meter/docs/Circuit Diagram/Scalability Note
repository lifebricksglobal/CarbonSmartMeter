## Scalability: From Portable to Farm, You’re Covered

| Installation | How It Works |
|-------------|--------------|
| Single Panel | 1 × ESP32 → USB-C → App |
| Portable Kit | Same flow, rugged case |
| Solar Farm | 1 Gateway aggregates 100+ panels → signs batch |
| Microgrid | Central node → same Ed25519 + threshold logic |

Same code. Same security. Same rewards, just at scale.
