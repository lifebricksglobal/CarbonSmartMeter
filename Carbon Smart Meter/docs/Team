Project Overview

In early 2024, Tom and Pat spent several months living and traveling throughout Asia, visiting Indonesia, 
Singapore, Hong Kong, and mainland China. During this time, they observed a clear and growing demand for 
renewable energy solutions. Their visit to the Singapore Airshow opened unexpected opportunities, leading 
to factory tours with leading manufacturers of solar panels and energy storage systems—an experience that 
connected their interests in both renewable energy and aviation innovation.

Following these insights, they decided to focus on products with the greatest global relevance and potential
for positive impact. Solar energy technologies were selected and shipped to various regions in Africa via 
both air and sea freight to test how different markets would respond to innovative renewable energy products 
supported by unique marketing strategies.

Among all tested solutions across three continents, the Carbon Smart Meter emerged as the standout product. 
Its seamless integration with solar energy systems demonstrated that extensive field testing had paid off.

Tom and Pat’s strong ties to the aviation industry further enhance their work. Tom’s background as a trainee 
pilot and Pat’s family connections to professional pilots enable the pair to engage naturally within aviation 
circles, attend key industry events, and connect with potential clients for their Carbon Credits Marketplace, 
a brokerage platform facilitating the transparent purchase and retiring of verified carbon credits, both 
on-chain and in the real world.

Supported by a distributed team of remote professionals, Tom and Pat have built a truly global network of partners.
